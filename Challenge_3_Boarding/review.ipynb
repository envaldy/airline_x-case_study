       "      <td>In the bigger scheme of things among all airlines, it provides a high level of service and offers a good product, though not outstanding. Staff service was professional and efficient but somewhat lacking in genuineness. Service, especially on the outbound, was very rushed. For example, the pre-departure hot towel was given and taken away before I could even touch it. Cabin crew can best be described as highly efficient but perfunctory. There is a high degree of helpfulness but also kind of stern. Seating was the same kind for inbound and outbound even though they were on different types of aircraft (B787 and A350). One is lucky to get flat-bed seating on a regional flight, but the seat is just uncomfortable, too narrow, and the head “wing” gets in the way and blocks the view from the window. The 3-point seatbelt was also uncomfortable. Food on the outbound was awful, even when it’s from “book the cook”. The duck was dry and pathetic looking, and tasted like it looked. On the inbound, the fish dish was excellent and succulent. I wonder if it’s from the Bangkok kitchen rather than from the Singapore kitchen. Beverages were good, with Piper Heidsieck champagne and a very good port, though the pre-takeoff champagne was served warm. There was strangely no beverage menu -- only a food menu with wine list. For the Singapore lounges, Terminal 3 lounge is renovated and expanded, and world class. Terminal 2 lounge is dated and in need of a revamp. The main issue with the Singapore lounges is the food – only mediocre local food is served. It is a real shame that there is no Western food, or other kinds of Asian cuisine such as Japanese and Middle Eastern. Singapore is not known for tasty food or fine cuisine, and the lounge food clearly reflects this. The lounge wines were very good, however; especially the 2 kinds of white. Lounge staff were rather surly. The Bangkok lounge was good enough for its purpose of being an outstation lounge. It has enough quantity and variety of seating and adequate F &amp; B, though there are no showers. F &amp; B on the whole – both on board and in the lounge – was one level below that of Qatar, though Singapore has better consistency in the various other aspects. Online check-in was very smooth and painless. You need not go to a counter nor get a paper boarding pass.\\n\\nOutbound:\\nCabin service: 3/5\\nMeal: 2/5\\nTerminal 3 lounge in Singapore: 4/5\\nTerminal 2 lounge in Singapore: 3/5\\n\\nInbound:\\nCabin service: 4/5\\nMeal: 5/5\\nLounge in Bangkok: 4/5\\n\\nGeneral:\\nOnline check-in: 5/5\\nSeating: 3/5\\nInflight entertainment: 4/5\\nInflight beverages: 4/5</td>\n",

Efficient boarding schedules and kiosk checkins all contribute to an excellent service. And the hot face washers are sooo refreshing.

       "      <td>Online check-in service was smooth and user friendly. Service for Luggages checked in at the Hong Kong Air Express Terminal was efficient. Particularly when you got trouble with hand carry, a piece of a bit oversized luggage (toy),  staff at the HK Airport Singapore Airline counter responded immediately and helped in-person effectively and efficiently 👏 👏, remarkable management. So were the staff at the boarding gate. During our flight from HK to Singapore, we were enjoying services from a team of professional, amicable, friendly and courteous crews. The plane was landed quietly and smoothly that one almost forgot it was landing on the ground if not being reminded. What else can I say: 👍, thank you Singapore Airline giving us such a plesant and memorial trip. Please keep up the excellent good work!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Singapore Airlines has a good entertainment system, but all good movies from their list I have already watched. Food was decent but nothing spectacular for economy seats. The ordeal was online check-in, it should be open 48 hr before flight, but for some reason I couldn't do it online and called customer service, and even they couldn't help me. They just suggested to check-in personally at the airport, and as we did we received the very end seats in spite of the fact we arrived early for check-in. I am travelling a lot and it was the first time with SA, I have heard only great things about Singapore but for our flight service was no different than one from Delta, or Aeroflot, or Lufthansa..</td>\n",

       "59    In the bigger scheme of things among all airlines, it provides a high level of service and offers a good product, though not outstanding. Staff service was professional and efficient but somewhat lacking in genuineness. Service, especially on the outbound, was very rushed. For example, the pre-departure hot towel was given and taken away before I could even touch it. Cabin crew can best be described as highly efficient but perfunctory. There is a high degree of helpfulness but also kind of stern. Seating was the same kind for inbound and outbound even though they were on different types of aircraft (B787 and A350). One is lucky to get flat-bed seating on a regional flight, but the seat is just uncomfortable, too narrow, and the head “wing” gets in the way and blocks the view from the window. The 3-point seatbelt was also uncomfortable. Food on the outbound was awful, even when it’s from “book the cook”. The duck was dry and pathetic looking, and tasted like it looked. On the inbound, the fish dish was excellent and succulent. I wonder if it’s from the Bangkok kitchen rather than from the Singapore kitchen. Beverages were good, with Piper Heidsieck champagne and a very good port, though the pre-takeoff champagne was served warm. There was strangely no beverage menu -- only a food menu with wine list. For the Singapore lounges, Terminal 3 lounge is renovated and expanded, and world class. Terminal 2 lounge is dated and in need of a revamp. The main issue with the Singapore lounges is the food – only mediocre local food is served. It is a real shame that there is no Western food, or other kinds of Asian cuisine such as Japanese and Middle Eastern. Singapore is not known for tasty food or fine cuisine, and the lounge food clearly reflects this. The lounge wines were very good, however; especially the 2 kinds of white. Lounge staff were rather surly. The Bangkok lounge was good enough for its purpose of being an outstation lounge. It has enough quantity and variety of seating and adequate F & B, though there are no showers. F & B on the whole – both on board and in the lounge – was one level below that of Qatar, though Singapore has better consistency in the various other aspects. Online check-in was very smooth and painless. You need not go to a counter nor get a paper boarding pass.\\n\\nOutbound:\\nCabin service: 3/5\\nMeal: 2/5\\nTerminal 3 lounge in Singapore: 4/5\\nTerminal 2 lounge in Singapore: 3/5\\n\\nInbound:\\nCabin service: 4/5\\nMeal: 5/5\\nLounge in Bangkok: 4/5\\n\\nGeneral:\\nOnline check-in: 5/5\\nSeating: 3/5\\nInflight entertainment: 4/5\\nInflight beverages: 4/5   \n",
       "194   Our first-time flying Singapore Airlines Business Class. I honestly could not fault the entire experience with Singapore Airlines from the online booking experience thru to the arrival in Singapore (We took advantage of pre-ordering our meal). Online check-in, no problem. Bag Drop no problem and an extremely helpful staff member who provided extremely useful pre boarding information. Boarding, no issues. Business Class cabin crew were excellent. The flight on the A350 aircraft was nice and smooth. On arrival in Singapore once we cleared all the formalities, we only had couple minutes wait for our baggage. We would have no hesitation flying with Singapore Airlines again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "217   Flew LAX-SIN-BWN (Brunei) on award ticket. Reasonably user-friendly website - able to book seat, special meal, etc. without hiccups. Smooth online check-in (boarding pass only at the airport due to document check). Very quick airport check-in. Smooth boarding process. Comfortable economy seats (better than average). Entertainment system with wide selection of movies. Free wifi, which worked well. USB ports and power sockets at each seat on the LAX-SIN flight. On the short SIN-BWN flight there was a USB port only, which was very weak and didn't charge my phone. Special meals were better than average. Both flights arrived early.\\nThe only thing I didn't like was the annoying music played on board the LAX-SIN flight for over 30 min prior to landing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "286   We flew from Sydney to Penang on Singapore Airlines and it is easy to see how they keep winning so many awards. Easy check in via the automated kiosk system, boarding was simple on both flights and the flight itself was great. The staff are helpful and very friendly.

Book the Cook option was not available, so we pre-booked the standard dinner menu, Vadouvan Curry Spiced-Chicken Breast with Preserved Lemon, which was better than the Veal Fillet we had at previous flight.\\n\\nWe sat at Row 11 during both flights, so we got to exit first, that's very cool!\\nThe first 2 rows were usually blocked during booking but they open up during online check-in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1883  inflight catering service taste good.  Blanket provided to every passengers without asking, better than flying with CX.  Cabin Crew is friendly and pleasant.  However, there is lack of assistance at the airport if you need early check in service (we've completed online check in a day before).  Our flight was at 6:30pm, we want to spend sometime at the new airport so we arrived early around 3:15pm,  However, we had been spending half an hour for self drop bag as we cannot print our boarding pass at the airport due to system error. With a very nice male staff helping for all 13 passenger in our group, we finally can move to next step to browse the airport.  However, indication from Jewel to other terminals is not so clear.  We only visited the waterfall, entrance fee of S$8 for only a few minutes shot, long queue at purchasing counter, after going up and down, we missed the way taking skytrain to T3 so we need to walk there from Jewel.   No extra time to explore stores or restaurant at T3..... then a bit rush to arrive immigration and boarding gate.  Perhaps another time .......                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1993  Easy to drop your bags and get your boarding passes. We are able to combine our luggage weight instead of having to worry about individual luggage. Highly recommend online check in 48 Hours before flight time. Smooth boarding in groups. Ample luggage storage space on board. Food we had was a choice between asian rendang and international breakfast. Smooth landing to boot.

That made us very happy as it would have been a pity if one leg differed from the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2269  Aircraft was Boeing 777-200, we got good seats 44A & C during online check-in.  Seats were blocked during reservation.

       "2883  As expected from Singapore Airlines, comfortable seats and legroom, simple online check-in and seats assignment. Since I've done online check-in, I just had to drop my baggage, get my passport checked & my boarding passes printed, took more or less 5 minutes only. Flew with SQ967 to Singapore, layover for about 2 hours (which I don't mind, since Changi is a comfortable airport) and connected with SQ672 to Nagoya.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2890  Online check was problematic - website keeps hanging.   Changed to mobile check in which was fine.  Airport self check and baggage drop off was good and staff on hand to help.  Flight was good.  Older plane so USB charging port.  Entertainment system was good and great movie/tv selection.  The flight I was on had 2 trainee flight attendants so food service was not smoothly orchestrated but no issues.  Everyone was smiling and pleasant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3239  Morning flight to Hanoi, and it was very comfortable in this A330-300 aircraft (2-4-2 configuration).  We got the double seating by the windows.  As I prebooked standard seats, upon online check-in, I could select the forward zone FOC!  Seat was so comfortable, I slept the entire flight.  Flight timing was perfect, arrived before noon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3427  We'd always heard how good Singapore Airlines is, and it appears to be true. Let's get the negative out of the way: check-in. It may be that U.S. regs prevent them from using online check-in, but that doesn't excuse the hour-long wait in line to check in. Or the chaos of boarding. But once on board, wow. The food is what passengers dream of. Two full meals on our 8.5 hour international flight. And the flight attendants -- they seem to hire only people who want to help. Smiling, eager to make the experience positive. Such a change from our flight over on United.

       "4077  My most memorable flight, because HKG Airport was shutdown a day before my departure due to intense protest with hundreds of flights cancelled.  \\n\\nLove the SQ App - I monitored the flight status closely, and it showed On Schedule.  \\nPrior to that I did my online check-in via the App, and was able to select good seats.  \\n\\nOn my departure day, in-town check-in at IFC was quite empty.  Flight departed on schedule, it was almost a full flight.  Excellent service as always.\\n\\nThis time I noticed great improvement in the food:\\n- Pea & crackers are served as apperitif, no more peanuts - great consideration of nut allergy passengers like me.\\n- Haagen Daz ice cream is served, no more cheap branded ice cream made somewhere in Southeast Asia (i shall not disclose the country of origin).\\n\\nFor the entertainment system, I found great Chinese movies especially Hong Kong and Chinese Mainland movies which I can't find in the cinemas in Singapore.  There system can even now link mobile devices wirelessly.\\n\\nKeep up the great service, I have 6 more SQ flights this year, looking forward them very much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "4258  As most Aussie’s who have the fortune to fly know, the long haul to Europe is a teeth gritting and keep smiling until it’s over affair. Singapore Airlines makes this just more enjoyable and endurable. Comfy seats, excellent and efficient flight attendants, frequent fluid offers, and ok meals make for a comfy journey. Efficient boarding schedules and kiosk checkins all contribute to an excellent service. And the hot face washers are sooo refreshing. I was extremely late for a flight but they still managed to accommodate me and my luggage without any fuss. Great service and can only highly recommend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "4438  Singapore Airlines offer an excellent service - from initial booking, confirmation emails, reminders to check in online (48 hours in advance) and actual online check in, to arriving at the airport, bag drop and actual time on the plane, everything says \"service\". Staff were friendly and attentive and helpful. I did, however, find the food not as good as I have experienced on earlier flights. Bread rolls were not very fresh and some of the meals were very bland. Despite this, I would certainly use Singapore Airlines again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "4710  We had just finished our long haul flight from the US to Singapore and had to switch airlines for our final leg. Let me say, the service was excellent from the moment we walked up to the counter to recheck our bags. The agents were friendly and polite, recognized our Star Alliance status without issue, and gave us lounge passes after our long flight to relax. The boarding process was quick and seamless with smiling and helpful flight attendants. \\n\\nThe standard amenities on Singapore Air were nice... All passengers are served a meal, and boy there are plenty to chose from during online check in (Kosher, Muslim, Vegan, etc.) They were quite tasty.  In flight entertainment in all seats, with several international movies and shows to choose from. All of the seats had power outlets to recharge. Our seats weren’t cramped like some US airlines either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "5381  Whenever I travel, SQ is always my 1st choice of Airline; the plane is new, on time schedule and good service. Online booking of SQ flight and online check-in process is easy, inflight entertainment is great too.

       "5428  The woman at the kiosk desk forgot to attach a luggage tag. Pardoned as I forgot to ask too. On arrival at the airport what I found though that not only was a baggage tag not provided at all - they had just put in some kind of sticker number with my name. The sticker was easy to remove and in essence the luggage could have belonged to anyone.  Find this strange - given that in case there were just clothes and toiletries there would have been no way of claiming it as mine - would have gotten into a fight of words. Thankfully that never happened. \\n\\nOn my arrival in Kolkata, I also found that not only had SQ staff forgotten to put a tag - they also found it quite permissible to look into personal property one by one, and mess that property up despite having had a scan and all the required processes done at the front end. I found my luggage looked into piece by piece. Toiletries misplaced and messed up - paperwork and some notes misplaced and missing. \\n\\nThis is one of a kind incidence which is highly unexpected of SQ. \\nHopefully this is a one - off and will not be repeated again in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "5843  A very good airline with a known good reputation. \\nPro's: \\n1. Service on board: very attentive friendly attendants and very clean toilets. \\n2. Food on board: generous amount and delicious. Varieties are also very good. \\n3. Ground service: very well prepared to handle flight transfers at delays. Their ground staff were already waiting for us to whisk us through the airport to catch our connecting flight when our previous flight was delayed. \\n4. Baggage allowance of 30 kg per person which is a lot more than (most of) Western airlines. \\n5. Transit at Changi airport which is for us one of the most comfortable airports. \\n\\nContra's: \\n1. The site for Online check-in did not work properly. It hung lots of time and didn't give clear messages when there was any issue (for example when the online check in of the connecting flight was not yet available or had to be done on their partner website). This has happened lots of time to us. \\n2.No information on the lack of meal/drink when work with a partner for a connecting flight (e.g. with Brussels Airlines) who does not offer free meal/drink during the flight.\\n3. Choices of modern (Western) movies were rather limited.  \\n4. Leg room in a normal economy class was rather limited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "7267  Singapore Airlines provides an excellent service and I would be pleased to fly with the airline again. The flight attendants are truly customer focused and we felt there was a little more leg space than some other airlines offer. The only glitch was the position of the middle rear seats on the flight from Singapore to Brisbane. The toilet is located on the other side of the aisle, in other words no screening between the passenger and the toilet. This is a very bad design and it didn’t show up in the seating plan when we were doing our online check in (I only hope that the airline addresses this bad design fault).  I was fortunate that there were spare seats and flight attendant Jiang Ping (J) arranged for me to change seats. Thanks to his actions, my opinion of Singapore Airlines remains the same - it is a great airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "7596  The experience of flying with one of the best airlines in the world was so exhilarating.\\nThe flight from CGK to KIX include a transit in SIN, the first leg CGK-SIN was on an old Boeing 777-300. The aircraft felt so old, the seat looks tired, the IFE was so outdated. It was a morning flight and was full, I requested to change my seat to isle seat during the check in and only able to have an isle seat at the last row.\\nThe second leg SIN-KIX was on a brand new Airbus A350-1000, the aircraft has a great leg room, comfy seats, the IFE was awesome.\\nI ordered Muslim meals for both leg prior to the flight, and it was tasty.\\nThe flight attendants were so nice and professional, they were able to quickly manage the food service for such a short flight from CGK to SIN and able to look calm and collected during a heavy turbulence in the flight from SIN to KIX.\\nThe only downside was that I have to pay to select my seat prior the online check in.

       "8108  Well now we know the meals have reduced to breakfast only on the overnighter we can be prepared next time with snacks or a heavier meal before we board.  We were not aware of the reduction in meal services and were pretty hungry till breakfast.\\n\\nThe online check in service is still a poor piece of technology that I have provided feedback on numerous occasions about without EVER any response (Yes I leave my contact details) so obviously there is a care factor in my opinion as zero.\\n\\nOn a positive note I am always amazed at the pilots and flight crew that get us to our destination safely and on time. They really are unsung heroes - I just wish the airline would treat them better so they can treat us as passengers better back there in cattle class. Safe airline is really my priority so well done to Singapore Air on this but you are not what you used to be that's for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8142  It was a pleasant experience onboard SQ 530 from Singapore Changi to SVPI Ahmedabad.\\n\\nHad used the kiosk at the airport for check-in and the automated bag drop for the cabin baggage. It was a nice experience and quite easy, too.\\n\\nImmigration at Changi doesn't utilise officers, just bio-metric of your finger and scan of passport. \\n\\nThere is a nice Singapore Food Street restaurant as well, to refresh oneself. Near it, is the air-side viewing area which provides good views of the air-side.\\n\\nBoarding was efficient. As usual on Singapore Airlines, the service begins with the serving of hot towels before take off and then proceeded by drinks. Finally, the meal was served.\\n\\nJust one thing that I find Singapore Airlines needs to make up for: the meal service. They must utilise multiple tray trolleys at one time so that the meal service is quick. In comparision to some other airlines of a lower standard, I got my meal after much time even though I wasn't seated in the end of the aircraft.\\n\\nOther than that, I can't find a flaw in the world's best airline for the year 2018.

       "8176  It was good to be back on SQ again after quite a long absence and far too many flights on budget airlines. Maybe that's why I appreciated this more than usual. Food was decent, service was professional and efficient, and I had an empty seat next to me. Online check-in worked well and the flight was on time. Operated on a B777-200ER with the older style fit-out, but still in good condition. All good over all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8441  We had done an online check in and only had to have our bags weighed and we were thinking that the process will be pretty quick, unfortunately this wasn't to be the case. The queue at check in was not long but it took an extraordinary amount of time to get to the counter. There were numerous people with overweight bags who then set about sorting the contents of their bags out at the counter. I really think these people should be asked to move away from the counter, sort out their bags and then rejoin the queue, holding everyone else up just does not seem right. Other people for reasons unknown took so long to process it had us scratching our heads. Once we reached the counter processing our bags took about 4 minutes and we were out of there. \\nThe flight however was very good, the staff are excellent and the meals served were really quite good. The onboard entertainment was more than enough for a flight of that length and even in economy the legroom was quite adequate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

The airline will ask for them during check in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "9347  Longhaul economy is a tough gig at the best of times. However, the A380 makes life just that much better. There are two crucial factors: Seat pitch and seat width. Although the stats say that seat pitch on the (SQ) Boeing 777 and the A380 are the same- it does not feel like it. Having made the return trip via the 777, the A380 definitely has more room (despite what the stats say).\\n\\nCheck-In: I highly recommend doing the online check-in and then bag drop only at the airport. Both in Sydney and in Singapore, the check-in process was the fastest I have ever had On both occasions, it was less than five minutes form the time we got to the check-in counters to the time we moved towards immigration.\\n\\nAs for Singapore Airlines for, drinks, seat entertainment, service - it is right up there. Ive flown a lot of international flights in last few years and the service would be equal to the best I've had.\\n\\nAnd, as a sidetone for any Gold or Platinum Velocity members -you get access the the Kris Lounges at the airport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

I was flying to Melbourne with SQ B777-300ER, and it was such a smooth flight.\\n\\nI managed to do an online check in via apps on Android and choose to seat on the 47C.

       "9630  Online check-in service was smooth and user friendly. Service for Luggages checked in at the Hong Kong Air Express Terminal was efficient. Particularly when you got trouble with hand carry, a piece of a bit oversized luggage (toy),  staff at the HK Airport Singapore Airline counter responded immediately and helped in-person effectively and efficiently 👏 👏, remarkable management. So were the staff at the boarding gate. During our flight from HK to Singapore, we were enjoying services from a team of professional, amicable, friendly and courteous crews. The plane was landed quietly and smoothly that one almost forgot it was landing on the ground if not being reminded. What else can I say: 👍, thank you Singapore Airline giving us such a plesant and memorial trip.

The ordeal was online check-in, it should be open 48 hr before flight, but for some reason I couldn't do it online and called customer service, and even they couldn't help me. They just suggested to check-in personally at the airport, and as we did we received the very end seats in spite of the fact we arrived early for check-in. I am travelling a lot and it was the first time with SA, I have heard only great things about Singapore but for our flight service was no different than one from Delta, or Aeroflot, or Lufthansa..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
